'''
This is an example preprocessor file for the Path workbench. Its aim is to
parse the contents of a given GCode file, and transform it to make it
suitable for use in a Path object. This preprocessor, once placed in the
appropriate PathScripts folder, can be used directly from inside FreeCAD,
via the GUI importer or via python scripts with:

import Path
Path.import("/path/to/file.ncc","DocumentName","pre_example")

It must contain at least a parse() function, that takes a string as 
argument, which is the unmodified contents of the input GCode file, and 
returns another string, that must respect the following 
rules in order to be used by the Path workbench:

- All lines must begin with a G or M command. Lines that don't respect that 
  rule will be discarded on import.
- Only one occurence of another letter can happen after a G  or M command. 
  For example this is invalid:
    G1 X1 Y2 
    X2 Y3
  You must write it like this: 
    G1 X1 Y2 
    G1 X2 Y3
- Center coordinates (I,J) in G2 and G3 arcs are relative to the last point.
